The attacks presented in the dissertation and the EuroSP'17 paper can be
reproduced using the virtualbox Vm available online [1]. The scripts and
data for the evaluation is in the repo.

The OpenFlow covert channel was jointly done with Robert Kr√∂sche. With
his permission, I have uploaded the code that he has authored as well as
code that was developed by me to analyze and visualize the data. Robert's
version of the code can be found on bitbucket [2].
